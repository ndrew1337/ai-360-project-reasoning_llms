So it's better to write:\n\nAnswer: (4 + 1) * (7 + (4 + 1)) = (4 + 1) * (7 + 5) = 5 * 12 = 60, no.\n\nWait, the steps are:\n\nStep 1: 4 + 1 = 5  \nLeft: 2, 5, 7\n\nStep 2: 7 + 5 = 12  \nLeft: 2, 12\n\nStep 3: 12 * 2 = 24\n\nSo final expression is: (4 + 1) * (7 + (4 + 1)) is invalid as 4 + 1 is used twice.\n\nBetter to write: (4 + 1) * (7 + (4 + 1)) no.\n\nSo just write the expression as: (4 + 1) * (7 + 5) = 24, where 5 = (4 + 1). So the expression is:\n\nAnswer: (4 + 1) * (7 + (4 + 1)) = 24\n\nOr with parentheses:\n\nAnswer: (4 + 1) * (7 + (4 +",
